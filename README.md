# Week 4: GitHub Actions Matrix Build for Multiple Python Versions

This is a Python GitHub Template Repository that includes the following contents:
- A .devcontainer configuration for a Python environment
- A Makefile with commands for setup, testing, and linting
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD Matrix Build for Multiple Python Versions [3.7, 3.8, 3.9]
- A requirements.txt for project dependencies
- A README.md with setup and usage instructions
- A main.py file to calculate the mean, median, std_dev for a set of data
- A test_main.py to test the main.py
  
## Prerequisites

- pytest
- statistics

## Report

For this project, I created a simple python file that calculates the mean, median, std_dev for a set of data and also a test_main.py that tests the python file with the GitHub Actions Matrix Build for Multiple Python Versions including python versions [3.7, 3.8, 3.9].
- Mean: 23.65
- Median: 20.0
- Standard Deviation: 16.875004873293644
